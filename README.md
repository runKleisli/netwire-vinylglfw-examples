# netwire-vinylglfw-examples

Port of netwire-input-glfw example to VinylGL & GLSL 1.50. Uses Netwire 5 and Vinyl >= 0.4. NetVinylGLFW is a previous combination of Netwire, VinylGL, & GLFW, but its Netwire and Vinyl versions are outdated as of 2016. The combination with STM that it suggests is embraced by netwire-input-glfw.

Usage: Place the executable and the `etc` folder in the same directory. Change to that directory in the command line and run the executable.

## Style progression

Style 0 follows the original structure of the netwire-input-glfw example.

Style 1 shows how the input structuralization step is obviated by the shader programs taking Vinyl records as input to begin with.
